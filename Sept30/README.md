***Meteorites Landed on Earth☄️💫***

Description: Data visualization of meteorites that has landed on Earth throught the history

- Work Process
  - Loaded & Processed data from csv files
  - Converted latitude & longitude to Cartesian coordinates referring to [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1185408/converting-from-longitude-latitude-to-cartesian-coordinates) stackoverflow post
  - Plotted each coordinate in the sphere and enabled users to rotate the sphere with their mouse

- Difficulties & Experiments
  -  It was challenging to draw a sphere at first since it was my first time using P3D, but it turned out to be a very rewarding experience.
  -  For the future improvement, a function that displays each country on the globe can help making the visualization more informative.

- Datasets
  - Meteorite landing history (https://www.kaggle.com/nasa/meteorite-landings)
  - Country coordinates (https://www.kaggle.com/parulpandey/world-coordinates)
