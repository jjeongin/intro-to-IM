# Final Project Prompt

## Concept
Generative artwork with the theme of light & space with Processing using user input from Arduino photo resister. ðŸ”­

Inspiration:


## Arduino
Arduino program will allow users to control the graphic/animation generated from Processing using photo resister as analog input. The program will send the light information to the Processing program and also visualize the brightness of the input light with LEDs using digital output.

## Processing
If the light is bright, Processing program will present animation inspired by the bright space scape. As the light gets deemer, the graphic will change accordingly.

## Challenges
Trickiest & most essential part will be to make dynamic and interesting random-generated graphic on Processing. To achieve this, I plan to research other generative artworks and experiment to find the interesting graphic.
